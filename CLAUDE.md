### MCP & Skills awareness (Cloude Code ToolBox)

_Last synced: 2026-07-02T14:08:46.395Z._

- **Full report:** `.claude/cloude-code-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md` in this workspace (auto-overwritten on each scan). Use it as ground truth for configured servers and skill folders.
- **MCP:** For **live tools** in Claude Code, enable the matching server via `/mcp`. Servers are configured in `~/.claude.json` (user) and `.mcp.json` (project).
- **When the user’s task matches a server** (e.g. Confluence work and a **Confluence** / **Atlassian** MCP is listed), **prefer that server id** and plan on tool use—not only file search.
- **Skills:** Folders below contain `SKILL.md`; attach or cite paths in chat when relevant.

# Memory bank (persistent context)

This repository uses a **memory bank** under `./memory-bank/` — structured markdown that survives sessions, similar to Cursor-style workflows.

Context layers (read deeper files after foundations): **projectbrief** → **productContext** / **systemPatterns** / **techContext** → **activeContext** → **progress**.

## What Claude should do

1. **Before substantive work**, read **all** of the following under `./memory-bank/` when the task depends on project state (not optional for non-trivial work). In **Plan mode**, reading for the plan is allowed; **do not edit** these files until **Act mode** unless the user only asked for a documentation/memory update with no code change.
   - `projectbrief.md` — scope and goals
   - `productContext.md` — product intent and UX
   - `systemPatterns.md` — architecture and conventions
   - `techContext.md` — stack and constraints
   - `progress.md` — done / pending / known issues
   - `activeContext.md` — current task and decisions

2. **During Act-mode work**, keep `activeContext.md` aligned with the current task (update when focus shifts).

3. **After meaningful milestones** (in Act mode), update `progress.md` and any affected docs in `./memory-bank/`.

4. When the user asks to **update memory bank** (or similar), **open and review every** file in `./memory-bank/`, then update what changed — especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`, even if other files are unchanged. Prefer doing heavy memory-bank writes in **Act mode** unless the user asked for documentation-only updates.

5. Prefer **short, factual updates** over long prose. Reference files, symbols, and tickets instead of duplicating code.

Do not delete these files; evolve them as the project changes.
